# Email-spam-prediction
 Hereâ€™s a professional GitHub repository description for your **Email Spam Prediction** project:  ---  ### **Email Spam Prediction Model** This repository contains a Python-based console application for predicting email spam using a machine learning model trained on the **Kaggle Email Spam Classification Dataset**. The project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and predictions.  ---  ### **Key Features** - **Console-Based Application**: User-friendly command-line interface for predictions. - **Machine Learning Model**: Built using scikit-learn, featuring models like Logistic Regression or other classifiers. - **Kaggle Dataset**: Utilizes a publicly available dataset from Kaggle for training and testing. - **Text Preprocessing**: Includes feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization. - **Accuracy**: Evaluates the model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  ---  ### **Technologies Used** - **Python**: Programming language. - **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for training and evaluation. - **pandas, numpy**: Data manipulation and analysis. - **TfidfVectorizer**: Text feature extraction.  ---  ### **Getting Started** 1. Clone the repository:    ```bash    git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-spam-prediction.git    cd email-spam-prediction    ``` 2. Install the required dependencies:    ```bash    pip install -r requirements.txt    ``` 3. Run the Python script:    ```bash    python main.py    ```  ---  ### **Dataset** The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle: [Email Spam Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/).  ---  ### **Usage** 1. Train the model with the Kaggle dataset. 2. Test the model with sample inputs or unseen data. 3. Predict whether a given email is **spam** or **not spam**.  ---  ### **Contributions** Feel free to contribute to this repository by: - Adding new features. - Improving the model's accuracy. - Providing additional datasets.  ---  ### **License** This project is licensed under the MIT License.
